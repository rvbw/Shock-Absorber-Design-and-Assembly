# Shock Absorber Design and Assembly

![Shock Absorber Assembly](images/Shock-absorber.png)

## 📌 Overview
This project presents the **design and mechanical assembly of a shock absorber system**.  
All components were designed from scratch and then assembled into a complete functional shock absorber.

The design follows a coil-over configuration, combining a spring and damper structure in a compact mechanical system.

## 🎯 Project Purpose
The objective of this project is to:
- Practice mechanical part design for motion and load absorption.
- Understand how shock absorber components interact mechanically.
- Apply proper assembly techniques for spring-based systems.

This project was created **for learning and training purposes only**.

## ⚙️ Design & Assembly Scope
- Custom design of all mechanical parts.
- Assembly of the shock absorber components into a single system.
- Focus on alignment, compression movement, and mechanical fit.
- No physical testing or simulation was performed.

## 🛠️ Key Components
- Shock body
- Coil spring
- Top and bottom mounting joints
- Internal shaft and support components
